## Core libraries

A quick overview with some of the Drupal core libraries.

> To get a **complete overview** of all the core libraries, take a look inside `core/core.libraries.yml`.

- `core/drupal`

We need `core/drupal` in order to take advantage of the `Drupal.behaviors`.

- `core/jquery`

To include the Drupal core version of jQuery, we add `core/jquery`.

- `core/jquery.once`

A jQuery plugin allowing to only apply a function once to an element.

> There are plenty more libraries in core.
